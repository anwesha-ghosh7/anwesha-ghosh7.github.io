## Project Pan — Fall 2025

### A Brief History of My Makeup Journey

I was about 10 years old when I started watching makeup videos on Youtube— Bethany Mota, James Charles, Meredith Foster, etc. I wasn't allowed to purchase or wear any makeup, of course. The best I had was a bit of tinted lip balm. Around the time I turned 13 years old, my mother, who herself never wore any makeup, got me my first eyeliner. This was a game-changer. I started wearing eyeliner to any special occasions like family dinners and birthday parties. 

I wasn't great at it, it would take me quite long to even get a straight line on my eyelid. I made it too thick and often had to rub my face with soap trying to get it out. But those early years with my tinted lip balm doubling as both lip and cheek tint, along with my messy eyeliner is what defined my love for makeup.  

The pandemic hit when I was about 15 years old. I was stuck in my house with nowhere to go which meant I didn't have an excuse to do any makeup. However, that was not about to stop me from putting colours on my face. I started painting my face with water colours. I made everything from flowers, hearts to sunsets that covered my entire jaw and cheeks. 

By the time the pandemic ended, I was about to graduate from high school. My parents had started giving me a small allowance to help me understand and manage my own finances. The first thing I did was buy myself another eyeliner. This was going to be the start of my first ever, very small makeup collection. By the time graduation rolled around, I was using mascara, concealer, blush and a lip gloss! 

In the summer between graduation and university starting, I experimented a lot with makeup. I even bought my first ever eye shadow palette— *Makeup Revolution London Forever Flawless Eyeshadow Palette in Affinity*. To this day, it is the only eye shadow palette I own. 

As I started University, I wore makeup everyday. This improved my skills like no other. I could now put on eyeliner in less than 30 seconds every day, and do my entire routine in less than 5-10 minutes. I am currently in my 3<sup>rd</sup> year of university, and my makeup collection has grown considerably, although not exponentially.

### What is Project Pan?

According to the internet, "Project Pan" is a social media challenge focused on using up existing beauty products like makeup and skincare before buying new ones, with the goal of reducing waste, de-cluttering, and saving money. The name comes from "hitting pan," the point in makeup like eyeshadow or blush when you've used so much that the metal pan underneath becomes visible. Participants often track their progress, share "empties," and document their journey on platforms like TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube.

To me, Project Pan is a way to use my makeup products and utilise them to their fullest. I don't own an excess of any category of makeup, and mainly have only a couple of items in each. But as someone who has always been very interested in makeup, I often find myself wanting to buy many makeup products to "try" them and also to have them in my "collection". I want to be more mindful of my consumption. Moreover, I very much want to invest my money in quality products, rather than buying a bunch of cheap copies. Project Pan helps me space out my purchases, so that I can save up to buy a select few items when I need them. This project will help me find new and creative ways to use the things I don't usually reach for. 

### The Plan:
I want to focus on a few products from my collection for the months of October, November and December in the year 2025. I am not hoping to hit pan or empty most of these products but I still want to use them as much as I can.

### Expectations

I am very curious to see how this project turns out. I am quite hopeful that I will be able to achieve at least one good pan! I think I am most excited for using my eyeshadow; I have been using it consistently this month, and the possibility of hitting pan has added to the excitement in my makeup routine. I expect to finish at least two of my lip products along with my eyeliner. I am also hoping to see a significant dip in my blush usage. Lastly, I do hope I can stick to my very first Project Pan.

### Note

**This Project Pan gets over on December 31, 2025. I will write my final result then, though I am not sure whether I will post updates before that time. We shall see how it goes :)**
